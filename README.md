# Fear

![](FunCityGlossary/Fear/Fear.png)

Fear and love can be viewed as the fundamental energetic fabric of reality. As such they also form the basis of all human emotions and determine the fundamental quality of all human actions. With love enabling choice, potential, possibility, and freedom, and fear consuming these attributes, leading to separation, jealousy, hatred, and destruction.
In a sense Fear can be understood as the absence of love, providing the contrast necessary for love to be perceived. Metaphysically, it is the mirror opposite of love, resulting in diametrically opposed behaviours and experiences. Embodying fear leads to perceiving the world as an empty space filled with separate objects or agents in constant struggle for survival, governed by game-theoretic dynamics. This perception creates a sense of separation, threat, and the intrinsic impulse to control the world. The energy of fear is fundamentally entropic, driving systems toward degeneration and conflict, often described as a “war of each against all” or hell.
